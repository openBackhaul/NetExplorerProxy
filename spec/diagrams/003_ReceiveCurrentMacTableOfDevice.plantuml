note over matr
  NEP initiates retrieval from MATR.

  After MATR has retrieved the data from the device, 
  it calls the receive operation of NEP 
  (with requestId)

note over nep
  <u>ReturnMacDataToExternalReceiver</u>
    The NEP receive operation calls the 
    Netexplorer receive operation and hands over
    the current MAC address data from MATR.
    The Netexplorer's address data and receive operation
    are retrieved from NEP memory with requestId as 
    lookup key.
